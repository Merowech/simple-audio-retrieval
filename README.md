# Simple Audio Retrieval Project 

Simple Audio Retrieval Project for Multimedia Retrieval 2: Advanced Topics from Prof. Daniel A. Keim, University of Konstanz.
  
This is the base repo and will provide code for a script to download songs from the FMA dataset for music analysis.

Another script will shortly introduce librosa and audio feature extractions.

# Task and Points
 a) Download the needed data and install the needed libraries.  
    Make yourself familiar with librosa and the data.  
 b) Extract features from the data and store it in way you prefer.  
    Connect the labels of the data with the data itself.  
    Create a train and a test set with a ratio of 80 / 20.  
 c) Create a similarity function based on your extracted features.  
    

## Goals
 - Students should learn to apply librosa feature extractors
 - Students should create a simple similarity function to find nearest neighbors
 - Students should build a simple web app to interactively search for nearest neighbors
 - Students should enhance web app with various additions, e.g., PCA plot of the data
